# Polygon-Clipping
Clip a polygon with respect to a clip rectangle formed by two vertical (left and right) and two horizontal (top and bottom) edges.

Language : C++
Library  : graphics.h

Input
• Four floating point numbers for four edges of clip rectangle: xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax
• Four characters for clipping order of four edges (L for Left, R for Right, T for Top, B for Bottom)
• No. of vertices in the polygon
• Co-ordinates (x and y values) of each vertex of the polygon. These co-ordinates will be floating point numbers.

Output
New sequence of vertex co-ordinates obtained after clipping with respect to each edge of the clip rectangle. After clipping with respect to an edge, generate a visual output displaying the original polygon and the latest clipped polygon.

If you face error in codeblocks you have to add graphics.h library into codeblocks. Follow the link given below.
